# When a user visits the home page, they should see a list of the documents in the CMS: history.txt, changes.txt and about.txt

- Each document within the CMS will have a name that includes an extension.
- This extension will determine how the contents of the page are displayed in
  later steps.


1. make the `public` directory
2. make the appropriate files in that directory
3. create a layout for the home page
4. display the files in the public directory on as an unordered list on the home page
